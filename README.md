## Informations

mangos-installer is a shell script to unify MaNGOS installation on GNU/Linux distribution.

    $ ./mangos-installer
    Usage: ./mangos-installer: [OPTIONS]
          -p <path>       : Path to MaNGOS (default: /opt/mangos-<version>)
          -d              : Set in debug mode
          -a              : Use ACE external
          -j <number>     : Number of jobs for make (default 1)
          -v <version>    : Set MaNGOS version (classic|tbc|wotlk|cata)
          -h              : Print this help

This script does all steps to install MaNGOS according GNU/Linux distribution :

* Install all dependencies (git, openssl, cmake, etc...)

    MaNGOS 0.12.2 (classic) rev 2389 has been installed !

On Debian/Ubuntu distributions you can use "-a" option because there is available packages for ACE (libace-dev) on mainstream repositories. MaNGOS is much faster to compile.

TBB libraries are always installed from distributions packages and not compiled.

All actions are logged in mangos-installer.log.

## Distributions

mangos-installer has been tested on several GNU/Linux distributions :

* Debian Lenny (5.0.x)
* Debian Squeeze (6.0.x)
* Debian Wheezy (7.x)
* Debian Jessie (testing)
* Ubuntu Precise (12.04)
* Ubuntu Quantal (12.10)

* CentOS 5.x
* CentOS 6.x
* Fedora Lovelock (15)
* Fedora Verne (16)

## Issues

* Debian Lenny (5.0.x) : You need to backport cmake (and libarchive also) from Squeeze because version is < 2.8
* Debian Lenny (5.0.x) : Don't use ACE packages from official repository because version is old
* CentOS 5.x : You need to install cmake >= 2.8 from rpm.pbone.net, pkgs.repoforge.org, etc...
